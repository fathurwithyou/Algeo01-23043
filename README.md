   - Sistem Persamaan Linier (Solving systems of linear equations)
   - Determinan (Determinant calculation)
   - Matriks Balikan (Matrix inversion)
   - Interpolasi Polinom (Polynomial interpolation)
   - Interpolasi Bicubic Spline (Bicubic spline interpolation)
   - Regresi Linier dan Kuadratik Berganda (Multiple linear and quadratic regression)
   - Interpolasi Gambar (Image interpolation)

   ## Installation

   ### Prerequisites
   Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
   - [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) version 11 or higher
